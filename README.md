# Getting Started with Create React PageStart

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React PageStart](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
That's the whole point of excluding the node_modules directory using your .gitignore file â€” You don't mistakenly mess up each others files. The package.json file handles it all.

Others should just run npm install and update their dependencies whenever anything is added to the package.json file.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
